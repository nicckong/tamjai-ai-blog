# TamJai AI Jeh Jeh: A Real-World LLM Project for Hong Kong's Food Scene

## Introduction

TamJai Yunnan Mixian, or just TamJai, as locals call it, is a Hong Kong staple. It’s cheap, customizable, and everywhere. I eat it often, but I always wondered: do people really feel differently about different branches? Are some actually better?

This got me thinking:  
**“If I’m in a new area, how do I know which TamJai to try — or skip?”**

That curiosity led to this side project: **TamJai AI Jeh Jeh**, an assistant that digs into public customer review data to answer everyday questions like:
- Which branches are most highly rated?
- How do people feel about TamJai in my district?
- What dishes come up the most?

It was a chance to explore new AI tools, tackle messy multilingual data, and design something genuinely useful. The result? An AI assistant that summarizes reviews, compares locations, spots trends, and switches between English and Traditional Chinese, all powered by real, unedited customer feedback.

## How It Works

I built TamJai AI Jeh Jeh to help people explore TamJai reviews in Hong Kong, in both English and Traditional Chinese. The system connects a friendly Streamlit interface to a modular backend hosted on Google Cloud Platform. Everything is powered by large language models (LLMs) and a set of focused tools.

Users can ask questions like:
- 寶林商場分店整體表現係點?
- 邊間分店土匪雞翼最好食?
- Which branch has the highest food rating?

Behind the scenes, every question flows through retrieval, summarization, analysis, and visualization — all using public review data.

## Architecture at a Glance

### Frontend:
- **Streamlit UI** with light/dark mode, bilingual toggle, and session memory

### Backend:
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** connects the LLM (Gemini) to the right tools

### Key Tools:
1. **Summarization**  
   - Uses LangGraph + ChromaDB for semantic vector search and bilingual summarization  
   - *Chroma was chosen for its lightweight, metadata filtering support, and free self-hosting, which is great for prototyping or smaller projects.*

2. **Math Tool**  
   - Translates natural language into SQL  
   - Connects to a PostgreSQL database of review metadata  
   - *PostgreSQL was chosen for its reliability, flexible schema support, and native integration with analytics tools.*

3. **Comparison**  
   - Blends quantitative (from the math tool) and qualitative (from summarization) results

4. **Charting**  
   - Dynamic Plotly charts rendered directly in the Streamlit interface

### Extras:
- Modular backend design allows for easy tool expansion  
- Google Cloud Storage used for syncing vector data and hosting project assets  
- Prompts fine-tuned for bilingual consistency

## Key Features & Demo

TamJai AI Jeh Jeh is built to be friendly, flexible, and useful—especially in a real Hong Kong setting. Here's what it can do:

### 1. Natural Language Q&A
Ask questions in English or Traditional Chinese. The assistant semantically searches reviews and summarizes them clearly, even across branches, districts and menu items.  
Example:  
"幫我總結荃灣區分店土匪雞翼的評價"

![NLP Demo](/assets/gifs/demo_q1.gif)

### 2. Branch Comparison (Quant + Qual)
Compare any locations side-by-side. See review counts, average ratings, and actual customer feedback. A mix of numbers and review summaries.  
Example:  
"比較觀塘區同將軍澳區分店嘅評價"

![Comparison Demo](/assets/gifs/demo_q2.gif)

### 3. Interactive Charts
Trend charts and rankings powered by Plotly, all inside the app. Explore top branches, review counts, and district-level insights visually.  
Example:  
"Plot the number of reviews by branch in Tsuen Kwan O"

### 4. Multi-part Questions
The AI can break the question into multiple parts and return a single answer.  
Example:  
"Which branch has most reviews in 2025? Summarize the reviews for this branch."

## What I Learned

This project was more than just a technical experiment. It was hands-on practice building AI systems that solve real-world problems and are actually enjoyable to use.

Key takeaways:
- **Prompt design is crucial.** Small tweaks to phrasing drastically improved quality and tone.
- **Modular design pays off.** With MCP, I could add or swap tools as the system evolved.
- **Messy data is the norm.** Reviews are full of slang and inconsistencies — good fallback logic is key.
- **AI = product thinking.** It’s not just about models — it’s about full-stack experience design.
- **Clarity beats complexity.** Clear summaries and charts matter as much as good algorithms.

## Next Steps

While this is an MVP, here are ideas I’d love to explore further:

- **📈 More Chart Options**
  - Let users pick chart types (bar, pie, line)
  - Add downloadable insights or reports

- **💬 Contextual Conversations**
  - Add short-term chat memory for natural follow-ups
  - Gracefully prompt for clarification on vague queries

- **🧠 Better Summaries and Patterns**
  - Improve sentiment interpretation
  - Cluster feedback for recurring themes

- **🌍 Expandability**
  - Apply the framework to other restaurant chains or domains
  - Package as a feedback analytics template

## Final Thoughts

This project started with a food craving — and ended up being a complete lesson in building AI tools that serve real people in a real city.

From data wrangling and prompt tuning to cloud costs and product polish, the TamJai Assistant helped me grow across technical and product dimensions. It’s proof that good AI doesn’t have to be flashy — just helpful, honest, and human-centered.
